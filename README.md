How to write a CGAL mesh to Wavefront OBJ file.

## Building

Edit the `Makefile` to your convenience. The default compiler is `g++`. For example, if you wish to compile with `clang`, change the `compile` and `link` commands into `clang++`.

To build the example, enter `make`. The executable will end up in the `build` directory.
